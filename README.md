* Specific financial problem the company is trying to resolve: 
    
    * Revolut is a digital banking alternative for free international money transfers and global fee-free travel. The company’s primary goals are:

        * To allow global spending and international transfers without expensive exchange rates. It is commonly known that financial institutions charge up to 3% on exchange rates when exchanging currencies or using your debit or credit card outside your home country

        * To provide multi-currency debit and credit card with no undisclosed exchange rates fees

        * To enable seamless domestic and international payments. It also included peer to peer payments to your phone contacts or people close to you

        * Frictionless platform for digital banking: checking account, bills, savings account, brokerage services for US stocks

* Intended customers:

    * Retail banking users across the world

    * According to Deloitte, three billion is the forecasted number of global users that will have access to retail banking services through smartphones, tablets, PCs and smartwatches by 2021. As per Resonate, the number of US consumers considering switching banks in the next 12 months increased by 86% from 2018, from 6.9 million to 11.9 million, due to needs of better digital banking services

    * In 2019, US financial services revenue from incumbent banks, was $1.35 trillion, per McKinsey, and it is expected that tech giants, or any other technology company are poised to grab up to 50% of this revenue



* Competitive advantage:

    * Main competitive advantage is the transparency in exchange rates. Competitors do not offer transparency on the real spot rate without fees during exchanges of currencies

    * Revolut also offers a frictionless app, very easy to use. Customers can open accounts through the app by taking a picture of their ID and a selfie

    * Revolut's main competitors; traditional retail banks, commercial banks and credit card companies; have a competitive disadvantage as their business models are based on attracting clients through branches and sales teams. As a result, they cannot offer low fees on exchange transactions and other banking services. Most of these companies have not developed competitive banking technology to provide a purely digital banking offering

* Technology:

    * Backend:

        Revolut’s technology stack is based predominantly on Java 11 on the backend

        The company is also introducing Kotlin for new components and its building its owned mobile APIs and micro services

        Additional technology: Dagger 2, RxJava 2, Room

    * Frontend: 

        ReactJS, Redux state container, Webpack modules and Sketch


## Landscape

* Fintech domain:

    Digital banking, payments & billing, blockchain and cryptocurrencies

* Major trends and innovations of this domain:

    -	Digitalization – self-directed customers
    -	Velocity of transactions
    -	Improvement of communication with clients and counterparties (automatic alerts to customers, swift confirmations, etc.)
    -	Fee transparency
    -	Cost reduction and margin compression

* Major competitors:

    * Traditional banks are still dominating the banking and payments business for retail and business clients. For example, Barclays or HSBC in the UK are some of the major players in this field while Chase or Wells Fargo have millions of clients in the US

    * Revolut will also compete with other financial technology companies in this field such as N26, Monzo or Starling

    * Revolut is expanding its operations into the broker dealer business so it will also compete with US companies such as Robinhood, E-trade, Fidelity and Charles Schwab in the near future


## Results

* Revolut hit 8 million customers as of December 2019. In February 2018, the company had 1.5 million customers

    -	The total number of users has grown by 169% in 2019
    -	Daily active customers grew by 380% in 2019
    -	Revenue grew by 354% in 2018 to GBP 58m
    -	Revenue from premium subscription plans (Revolut Premium and Revolut Metal) have grown by 154% in 2019

* Core metrics and performance:

    * Revolut’s principal metric is revenue growth. The company also has sub-metrics that have a direct impact on revenue growth; these sub metrics are:
        -	Customer growth
        -	New product launches
        -	Optimization of existing products
        -	Market expansion

    * The company also measures cost of sales and gross profit margin for the business

    * Revolut, as any other startup, also measures success based on its valuation

    * In October 2017, Revolut raised $71mm at a valuation of $350. In April 2018, the company raised $350m to a valuation of $1.7bn. In February 2020, the company raised $500m at a $5.5bn valuation

    * Given the revenue and customer growth as well as the rapid increase in valuation, I consider that the company is performing extremely well compared to the growth shown by traditional retail and consumer banking

* Performance comparison:

    * N26, which was founded in 2013, has a total valuation of $3.5bn (as of July 2019). Revenue in 2018 was GBP 58.2m compared to GBP 10m in 2017

    * Monzo which was founded in 2015, has a total valuation of $2.5bn (as of June 2019). 2 million users as of April 2019

    * Given this data, Revolut is performing better than N26 as the company has shown a greater valuation increase in a shorter period of time and Revolut has a higher valuation for the same revenue generated. Regarding Monzo, the company is worth $2.5bn compared to Revolut’s $2.5bn but a quarter of its users, which could lead to think it is a more profitable business



## Recommendations

* In my opinion, Revolut could offer the following products:

    * Robo advisor services for active investors and retirement planning. Revolut’s client based is young. This population is already investing and saving for future needs (such as buying a house) and retirement; or will eventually start saving at some point

        By offering these products, you can leverage your existing clients and benefit from cross selling

        The sales pitch would be similar to the existing one: low and transparent investment-associated costs (TER – Total Expense Ratio)

        The product offering could be *"open–architecture"* offering for self-directed investors as well as separately managed accounts through passive vehicles

    * Lending and Mortgages – Similar to the potential Robo advisor services that Revolut could offer, its young client based would also be interested in lending and mortgage products such as:
        -	Margin loans for active investors
        -	Personal loans
        -	Auto loans
        -	Mortgages for primary residences

These two additional products could boost the company’s revenue, either by engaging existing clients or accessing new customers that are looking for alternatives in the digital banking and brokerage industry

Offering these products would benefit the company because the target customers are the same than for general online banking products. If the company does not offer these products, existing customer will need to find those products in another financial provider

Additionally, by not offering these products, Revolut could also jeopardize its existing client based because, generally speaking, when a customer open a new brokerage account or obtain a new mortgage, the bank will offer additional banking services to the client (i.e.: checking account for auto payments for the mortgage, checking account for trade settlement, among other)

In order to keep with its current success and frictionless features, the company will need to develop these products based in the current technology explained above that has proven its success

For the brokerage capabilities, the company could leverage existing platforms such as Reuters or Bloomberg for real-time data feed
